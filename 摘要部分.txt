Venture-Captain Drandle Dreng orders the Pathfinders to
investigate the fate of Anumet Akrostera, who was sent there
to aid Nigel Aldain in his search for a key to the mysterious
portal within the museum’s catacombs. The Pathfinders
discover a haunted observatory in the museum that once
imprisoned the Devourer of Reason. After confronting
the tortured spirit of Anumet in the form of a haunt, they
learn of the Pathfinder’s grisly fate and gain possible clues
about his slayer’s goals, discovering that whoever is posing
as Anumet took a book from the museum called History of
the True Art.
In order to fully discover what exactly the Devourer plans,
Nigel Aldain suggests that the party seek out the knowledge
of the learned Maren Fuln at the Arcanamirium or perhaps
try to locate another copy of History of the True Art at Forae
Logos. The PCs then take to the streets in order to find out
where the Devourer of Reason was headed when he fled the
museum. Their search eventually leads them to the Tower of
the Horn, one of three ruined towers that once belonged to
the ancient wizard Beldrin. The Tower of the Horn is buried
beneath the surf most of the time, and is only accessible at
the tide’s nadir. The PCs must enter the perilous tower and
discover what their antagonist is up to before it is too late,
all the while fighting back the monstrous inhabitants of the
tower and solving its puzzles. The PCs finally encounter the
Devourer of Reason in the treasure-filled vault of the Tower
of the Horn; they must destroy the otherworldly monster to
avenge Anumet and claim the key to the mysterious portal
beneath the Blakros Museum, lest the Devourer use the
portal for its own mysterious and destructive goals.
