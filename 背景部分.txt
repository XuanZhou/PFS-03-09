T he ancient halls of Blakros Museum, a structure of
incredible antiquity, have witnessed many strange
events over the centuries. The eccentric astrologer
Ralzeros the Overwatched originally built this sprawling
stronghold of black basalt carved from the bedrock of
the Isle of Kortos as his sanctum and observatory. With
his myriad astrological devices, Ralzeros observed the
otherworldly forces that resided in the Dark Tapestry far
beyond Golarion, and in turn, those forces watched him.
These unknowable beings of the cosmos went so far as
to provide Ralzeros with an assistant, a ghoul known as
the Devourer of Reason. Though the monster provided
Ralzeros with numerous secrets of the void, when it
betrayed him by feasting upon one of his favorite human
assistants, the astrologer imprisoned the monster in one
of his stronghold’s numerous attic spaces, and the undead
horror was promptly forgotten when Ralzeros disappeared
not long after.
Now the enormous building belongs to the influential
Blakros family, who converted the structure into a museum
to display their various treasures. Rumors persist, however,
that the place remains haunted by dark magic, and incidents
of murder and madness remain seem drawn to the place. In
recent years, the Decemvirate has made it into the museum
curator’s good graces by helping with numerous incidents,
and the Society has taken this opportunity to look into
more of the building’s oddities and discover its secrets.
Recently, the museum’s curator, Nigel Aldain, discovered
a new layer to the catacombs that lie beneath the Blakros
Museum, a layer containing a strange copper portal clearly
of an ancient and magical nature. Where this portal leads
remains a mystery, but when Nigel offered the Pathfinder
Society the opportunity to send an agent to help research
the matter, the Grand Lodge jumped at the chance, sending
a Pathfinder named Anumet Akrostera to help the curator
in the search for a key to open the portal. Anumet proved
a valuable asset in exploring the countless nooks and
crannies of the museum, but his explorations proved to be
his undoing, as he inadvertently stumbled upon and opened
the chamber that bound the Devourer of Reason.
The Devourer of Reason ravaged Anumet’s mind as it
tore him to pieces, and saw that the Pathfinder intended to
unlock the copper portal in the catacombs of the building
(a door that the Devourer remembered as the entrance
to a vault containing many potent wonders. Maddened
by its long imprisonment and driven to wreak as much
destruction as possible, the Devourer used Anumet’s
knowledge to locate a tome it knew would show it how to
open the copper door, an ancient text entitled History of
the True Art, which contained numerous cryptic entries
written by Ralzeros himself. From this book, it learned that
Ralzeros’s feud with the mage Beldrin (whose towers can
still be seen from the Precipice Quarter) may have stemmed
from accusations that Beldrin stole one of Ralzeros’s famed
keys, keys that would allow whoever wielded them access to
a portion of the many magnificent treasures and wonders in
the expansive catacombs beneath his stronghold. Seeking
to unlock the portal at any costs, the Devourer of Reason—
disguised as Anumet—made haste toward the Tower of 
the Horn in search of the key. Nigel, noticing the serious
shift in Anumet’s normally calm demeanor, reported the
incident to the Pathfinder Society in hopes that they may be
able to more fully investigate the matter.
